# [GA4] What Does the (not set) Value Mean in Your Reports

Learn why (not set) appears in Google Analytics reports and how to reduce it.

## Why (not set) appears

The (not set) value in Google Analytics reports indicates that GA4 did not receive data for a specific dimension. This is most common in traffic source dimensions such as Campaign ID, Campaign Name, Creative Format, Marketing Tactic, Medium, Source, and Source Platform.

The most common causes are:

- Missing session start information: the `session_start` event is collected automatically when a session begins and carries attribution data. If it is missing, attribution can break.
- Configuration command firing late: ensure the GA4 config command fires before any event commands.
- End-user consent issues: if you use Consent Mode, verify that tags are implemented correctly and default consent values are set and propagated across all pages. In some cases, even with auto-tagging enabled, the Google Click ID (GCLID) cannot be used as expected. This can happen when `ad_user_data` is denied. As a result, campaign dimensions may show (not set). To improve this, combine manual tagging (UTM parameters) with auto-tagging.
- Consent not passed across pages: if a user updates consent to granted, make sure this updated state is sent on all pages in the session.
- Google Ads account unlinked: unlinking a Google Ads account from a GA4 property can cause (not set) values in campaign reporting. Even if you do not import GA4 conversions into Ads, the link is still important for accurate reporting.
- Auto-tagging not enabled: auto-tagging appends the GCLID parameter to landing URLs and helps GA4 identify which ad was clicked. If it is off, attribution gaps can occur.
- UTM parameters missing or incorrect: when you rely on manual tagging, incomplete or incorrect UTMs can produce (not set) in source/medium/campaign dimensions.
- Processing time: (not set) can appear while GA4 is still resolving traffic source values. Data may be updated later.

## Less common reasons for (not set)

- Redirect chains that drop query parameters.
- Custom scripts that rewrite URLs and strip UTMs.
- Cross-domain tracking not configured for all relevant domains.
- Measurement protocol events missing source parameters.

## High rates of (not set): what to do

- Audit `session_start` events and confirm they are firing on every session.
- Confirm GA4 config tags fire before any other events.
- Review Consent Mode implementation and verify consent states are propagated across pages.
- Enable Google Ads auto-tagging and keep GA4 and Ads linked.
- Standardize UTM tagging and validate URL builder rules.
- Check redirects and URL rewrites for parameter loss.

## Notes

Changes in GA4 take time to reflect in reports. Updates can take 24 to 48 hours to appear.
